Color correction software suite. Consists of:
* PyQt desktop app (color correction functioning properly, unfinished UI)
* Flask web server for sharing presets (under development)
* Kotlin Android app for applying pre-made cloud presets (development pending)

Desktop app allows to define color substitution mapping on CIE Lab color space using a grid UI.
Simply speaking, you can color red items in the image into blue, so that they'll look natural - 
all shadows and highlights remain the same.
